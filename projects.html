                <p>
                    In this project, I wrote a basic html about myself. This
                    was the first web page I created.

                    In this project, I was given a vocabulary list that I 
                    had to add to an html page and style. This was my first
                    project working with CSS to add personalization to a 
                    project. I enjoyed watching it come to life.

                    This project was my first solo project. Designing the 
                    html and CSS for this and watching it all come together
                    was so interesting! I felt accomplished looking at the 
                    final web page I had created.
