            <p>Hello! My name is Brittney Kennell. I chose to switch career paths and dive into 
                web development because I am very creative. I love a challenge and want a career 
                that pushes me to test the knowledge I already have as well as allowing me to 
                learn new things. I can't wait to see what the tech world has in store for me! 
            </p>
